/**
 * intentClassifier — lightweight regex-based message router
 *
 * DEMO mode: This runs on every student message and determines routing.
 * In DEMO, ALL classes route to the live Gemini Simulator.
 *
 * PRODUCTION design: This is the core of the CAG architecture.
 * HINT_REQUEST, CONCEPT_QUESTION, CODE_PASTE → served from KV CAG bank
 * CURVEBALL_ACK, OFF_TOPIC → served from static string constants
 * NOVEL_INPUT → only this fires a live Gemini call (~15% of all turns)
 *
 * Cost projection: At 1 lakh students × 8 turns avg × 15% LLM rate
 * = ~120,000 Gemini calls for an entire exam window (vs 800,000 without CAG).
 * Savings: ~85%. Free tier limit can be protected with batching + queueing.
